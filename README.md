#Wind Tunnel with Smoke

##This is a pure html5 website that I created for upload part of my work doing my last project in the course of Mechanical Engeneering.

####I put in this repository the full pdf in which I wrote the whole process to construct a wind tunnel to be used in Engeneering classes. However the main porpose was not this construction itself, but to verify if it was possible to construct some form of smoke generating. The reason for that is that my former University already had a wind tunnel, but didn't have a way to see the flow.

Humankind knew intuitively and for a long time that there were differences between moving objects in and outside the water. However, only in the beginning of the twentieth century, with the disclosure of the concept of boundary layer presented by the german physicist Ludwig Prandtl, that it was possible to explain the reasons of the difficulties related to moving an object in and outside of the water. Up to now the concept of boundary layer is a dominant one which is highly used in the scope of aerodynamics. In order to provide practical continuity to the abovementioned theory there are, nowadays, wind tunnels which can be seen as instruments for testing products with varied geometry and subject to different flow types. In addition, as a way of identifying the streamlines, the idea of adding smoke into these wind tunnels was introduced. In this sense, the studies related to ways of creating smoke and inducting outflow in wind tunnels are of great relevance for engineering. In this regard, the present dissertation aims to assemble a bench in order to observe streamlines in air flows utilizing smoke. This duty was accomplished using a exploratory research methodology. Besides that, tests were conducted with a commercial fog machine in order to calculate Reynoldâ€™s number of some of the obtained results. Finally, it was possible to conclude that glycerin is a reasonable material for smoke generation and that it is more advantageous to buy a commercial smoke machine than produce one to visualize streaklines in air flows in a wind tunnel.

There are some videos made in the process in my [Youtube Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vSmKvxck2A&list=PLtm1H290Jxz1lnML41ECOZmhYzVpsucOK).
